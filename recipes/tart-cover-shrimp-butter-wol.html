    <h2>Description</h2>

        Whatever you do, avoid this dish. It is by far one of the most potent meals known to mankind and deserves no place in a pet-owner's diet.

    <p>
        You are not hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are not thirsty.
    </p>
    <p>
        You are merely mad at your husband for choosing to eat this for dinner and want to take matters into your own hands.
