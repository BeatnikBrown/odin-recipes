    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe is even worse. You have two basic lemons in a jar, and you throw them in the pot and boil. And then you can’t decide whether to strain the juice or add more lemons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Honestly, I would never use fresh lemons in this recipe again. It’s not worth the trouble of squeezing and cutting. And really, you probably want to buy lemons, not make them.
