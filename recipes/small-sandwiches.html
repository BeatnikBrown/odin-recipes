    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        They aren’t good recipes. In fact, almost all of them are terrible. For example, the roasted turkey and cranberry sauce recipe in the book made me gag and actually stop to vomit.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course, I don’t have access to raw turkey and cranberries, so I’ll have to settle for this recipe instead.
